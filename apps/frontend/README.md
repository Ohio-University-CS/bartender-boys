# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have Node.js installed on your system:

### Installing Node.js

1. **Visit the official Node.js website**: Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **Download the LTS version**: Choose the "LTS" (Long Term Support) version for stability
3. **Run the installer**: Follow the installation instructions for your operating system
4. **Verify installation**: Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

You should see version numbers for both Node.js and npm.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## Testing on Native Devices

To test the app on your physical device, you'll need to install the **Expo Go** app:

### Installing Expo Go

1. **For iOS devices**:
   - Open the App Store
   - Search for "Expo Go"
   - Install the official Expo Go app by Expo

2. **For Android devices**:
   - Open Google Play Store
   - Search for "Expo Go"
   - Install the official Expo Go app by Expo

### Running the App on Your Device

1. **Start the development server** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

2. **Scan the QR code**:
   - **iOS**: Use your device's camera app to scan the QR code displayed in the terminal
   - **Android**: Use the Expo Go app to scan the QR code

3. **Alternative connection methods**:
   - **Same network**: Make sure your device and computer are on the same Wi-Fi network
   - **Tunnel mode**: If you're having network issues, press `s` in the terminal to switch to tunnel mode

### Development Options

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
