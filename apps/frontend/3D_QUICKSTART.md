# 3D Bartender Feature - Quick Start

## ✅ What's Been Added

### New Files
- `components/BartenderAvatar.tsx` - 3D avatar component with animations
- `assets/models/` - Directory for your custom 3D models
- `3D_MODEL_GUIDE.md` - Complete guide for customizing the 3D model

### Modified Files
- `app/(tabs)/chat.tsx` - Integrated 3D bartender avatar
- `package.json` - Added 3D rendering dependencies

### Dependencies Installed
```
expo-gl@16.0.7
three@0.166.1
expo-three@8.0.0
expo-asset@12.0.9
@types/three@0.166.0 (dev)
```

## 🎯 Current Features

### 1. Placeholder 3D Character
- Simple geometric bartender (head, body, arms)
- Orange shirt color (bartender theme)
- Skin-toned face with eyes

### 2. Animations
- **Idle**: Gentle bobbing motion when not talking
- **Talking**: Energetic movement when AI responds
- Auto-duration based on message length (~150 words/min)

### 3. Integration
- Shows at top of chat screen
- Automatically animates when assistant sends messages
- Smooth transitions between idle and talking states

## 🚀 How to Run

### Start the App
```powershell
cd apps\frontend
npm start
```

Then choose your platform:
- Press `w` for web browser
- Press `a` for Android emulator
- Scan QR code with Expo Go on your phone

### Test the 3D Avatar
1. Navigate to the **Chat** tab
2. Send a message to the bartender AI
3. Watch the 3D character animate when it responds!

## 🔧 How to Add Your Own Model

### Quick Steps:
1. Export your 3D model as GLB or GLTF format
2. Place it in `assets/models/bartender.glb`
3. Update `chat.tsx`:
   ```tsx
   <BartenderAvatar 
     isTalking={isTalking} 
     height={250}
     modelPath={require('@/assets/models/bartender.glb')}
   />
   ```

📖 **See `3D_MODEL_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions**

## 📱 Platform Support

- ✅ **iOS** (via Expo Go or development build)
- ✅ **Android** (via Expo Go or development build)
- ✅ **Web** (works in browser but may have limited 3D performance)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### TypeScript Errors
The TypeScript errors you see (JSX, React hooks, etc.) are temporary and will resolve when:
- VS Code language server restarts
- You reload the window (Ctrl+Shift+P → "Reload Window")

These don't affect runtime - the app will run fine!

### Model Not Loading
- Verify file path is correct
- Check that file is in `assets/models/` directory
- Look at console/terminal for error messages

### Performance Issues
- Reduce model polygon count (< 50k triangles)
- Optimize textures (use 1024x1024 or smaller)
- Test on physical device (better than emulator for 3D)

## 📋 What's Next?

To enhance the 3D bartender:
- [ ] Add your custom 3D model
- [ ] Include animations in the model file
- [ ] Add text-to-speech for voice
- [ ] Add lip-sync using morph targets
- [ ] Add more gesture animations (greeting, thinking, etc.)
